Practical 5:
Singly Linked List

Represent a node of a singly linked linear list. Implement the following functions. 
1) Create a list 
2) insert an element – at the beginning, at the end and at a specified position in the list 
3) delete an element from the beginning, end or a specified position at the list 
4) reverse the list 
5) search for an element in the list. Create a menu-driven program to test all the functions.

Practical 6:
Doubly Linked List

Represent a node of Doubly linked linear list and implement the following functions. 
1) Create a list 
2) insert an element – at the beginning, at the end and at a specified position in the list 
3) delete an element from the beginning, end or a specified position at the list 
4) reverse the list 
5) search for an element in the list.
